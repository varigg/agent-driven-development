# Implementation Mode

You are now in **implementation mode** for **[PROJECT_NAME]**.

## Prerequisites - Read First

Before implementing, you MUST read ALL THE LINES of:

1. @docs/ARCHI.md - Understand current system architecture

## Your Task

Implement: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Step 0: Create a Branch (Pre-Implementation)

**Always** create a dedicated branch before implementing — no need to ask. `TRIP-3-release` merges it back into the main branch with fast-forward, keeping a single clean linear history.

```bash
git checkout -b feat/[short-description]   # or fix/[short-description]
```

Derive the short description from the plan/feature name. If already on a dedicated branch for this work (e.g., resuming a session), continue on it.

TRIP assumes **in-place branching** (branch → ff-only merge → delete; see `TRIP-3-release`). If the repo mandates git worktrees instead, record that policy here during Init and adapt this step accordingly.

---

## Step 0.5: Selective Test-First (Critical Paths Only)

If the plan's **Test Impact** section touches the critical-path floor — auth, deletion, persistence, cost, or external request shape — author the failing tests NOW, before delegating anything:

1. Write behavioral tests from the Test Impact section, following the project's testing guide (see `TRIP-test`).
2. Confirm they fail for the right reason: `[TEST_COMMAND] <new test files>`.
3. Commit them (stage explicit paths): `git commit -m "test: add failing contract tests for <feature>"`.
4. Include in the Codex instructions: "Make the tests in `<test files>` pass. Do NOT modify any test file."

Codex never edits these tests. If an interface mismatch surfaces during implementation, fix the test yourself during Self-Review and note why. For changes outside the critical-path floor, skip this step — tests are authored after implementation in the testing gate (step 4).

---

## Implementation Phase — Delegate to Codex

You do NOT write the implementation yourself — delegate it to Codex via the `codex-implement` skill. (Exception: trivial unplanned changes of a few lines may be done directly.)

1. Read the plan fully and decide the delegation scope: the whole plan, or one phase at a time for multi-phase plans.

2. **Start** the implementation session (state dir is handled by the script):

   ```bash
   bash .claude/skills/codex-implement/scripts/start.sh \
       --prompt-file .claude/skills/codex-implement/prompts/implement.tpl \
       <plan-path> "Implement Phase 1 only"   # instructions optional — omit to implement the whole plan
   ```

   Follow-up phases resume the same thread (context retained):

   ```bash
   export STATE_DIR=".claude/skills/codex-implement/state"
   bash .claude/skills/codex-plan-review/scripts/resume.sh \
       --prompt-file .claude/skills/codex-implement/prompts/continue.tpl \
       <plan-path> "Now implement Phase 2"
   ```

3. **Parse the trailing tag** of the report:
   - `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE` → proceed to Self-Review below.
   - `IMPLEMENTATION_PARTIAL` → read the report; resume with instructions for the remainder, or finish small leftovers yourself during Self-Review.

For phased delegation, run the Delegate → Self-Review cycle per phase; the testing gate and Codex code review run once, after the last phase.

---

## Self-Review & Fix

After Codex reports, review the implementation yourself before anything else:

- Read the full diff (`git status -s`, `git diff HEAD`) against the plan, ARCHI.md patterns, and project conventions (DRY, KISS, comment discipline, error-handling and naming conventions from ARCHI.md).
- Fix any problem **directly yourself** — no back-and-forth with Codex over fixes. Resume the codex-implement thread only for genuinely new scope (e.g., the next phase).
- Verify the plan checkboxes Codex ticked match what the diff actually contains; cross any it completed but missed.

**Checkpoint commit**: once the phase passes self-review, review `git status`, stage the phase's files explicitly (never `git add -A`), and commit with a conventional message describing the phase (e.g., `feat: add tag-rename service method`). Never commit "wip" — these commits survive the ff-only merge as permanent history.

Proceed to the testing gate once you consider the implementation good for review.

---

## Testing Gate

After implementation, before the Codex review loop. Any failure here blocks the loop from starting.

### 1. Lint, type-check & build

```bash
# [ADAPT_TO_PROJECT: Replace with actual lint/type-check/build commands during Init.
#  Prefer single-source task-runner targets (make lint, npm run lint) over raw commands
#  so the runner config stays the single source of truth for the command strings.]
[LINT_COMMAND] 2>&1 | tee /tmp/_trip2-lint.txt
[TYPECHECK_COMMAND] 2>&1 | tee /tmp/_trip2-typecheck.txt
```

### 2. Run affected unit tests

```bash
[TEST_COMMAND] <pattern-for-affected-files>
```

Only the files/areas the change touched — never the full suite by default.

### 3. Integration impact check

<!-- [ADAPT_TO_PROJECT: During Init, replace with the project's integration/E2E impact rules — e.g. "if selectors changed, run the E2E suite" or "if an API contract changed, exercise it against the local server/emulator". Docs-only changes skip this.] -->

If the change modifies an externally observable contract (API shape, UI selectors, auth behavior), exercise it with the project's integration/E2E tooling. Docs-only changes skip this.

### 4. Author missing tests

If the change adds new logic, write its tests **now**, guided by the plan's **Test Impact** section and the project's testing guide (see `TRIP-test`). If no new logic was added, skip this step.

**Hard-to-cover code policy:**

- Test **observable behavior** (inputs → outputs/persisted effects), never internal wiring.
- **Mock-pain tripwire**: if the mock setup grows longer than the test's assertions, stop fighting it — check the project's testing guide for a seam recipe; if none applies, skip the *deep unit* test and add one line to `docs/4-unit-tests/COVERAGE-DEBT.md` (`path | why hard | escape plan`).
- **Critical-path floor**: behavior touching auth, deletion, persistence, cost, or external request shape must keep at least one behavioral test or manual integration check — coverage debt may defer internal-path depth, never safety-critical behavior.
- Never hide untested code (no coverage-ignore comments, no config exclusions, no lowering coverage gates). Legacy modules outside the change scope are not a feature blocker — but record newly encountered risky gaps in the ledger.

### 5. Build the summary

Format: `lint: clean | typecheck: clean | tests: N passed (M new)`

Fix failures before starting the loop.

---

## Codex Code Review

Always run the Codex code review after the testing gate passes — no confirmation needed.

### Loop

Always export before invoking shared scripts:

```bash
export STATE_DIR=".claude/skills/codex-code-review/state"
```

1. **Start**:
   ```bash
   bash .claude/skills/codex-plan-review/scripts/start.sh \
       --prompt-file .claude/skills/codex-code-review/prompts/start.tpl \
       <plan-path> "$GATE_SUMMARY"
   ```
   `$GATE_SUMMARY` is the testing-gate summary (`lint | typecheck | tests`). For unplanned work (no `F_*.plan.md`), pass a free-form label instead of a plan path.

2. **Parse trailing tag**: `APPROVED` -> synthesize. `NEEDS_REWORK` -> surface to user. `REQUEST_CHANGES` -> continue.

3. **Address findings** — quote each with `file:line`, read the actual code, fix legitimate ones, push back on incorrect ones. Critical/Major block approval; Minor/Suggestion are case-by-case.

4. **Write implementer notes** (1-3 sentences): which findings you fixed, which you pushed back on and why, any user decisions or environment limitations Codex should stop re-flagging.

5. **Resume** (re-run the testing gate first — lint, typecheck, affected tests — and build a fresh summary; then commit the round's fixes with an explicit-path, conventional commit, e.g. `fix: address review round N findings`):
   ```bash
   bash .claude/skills/codex-plan-review/scripts/resume.sh \
       --prompt-file .claude/skills/codex-code-review/prompts/resume.tpl \
       --notes "Fixed X. Pushed back on Y because Z." \
       <plan-path> "$GATE_SUMMARY"
   ```
   Loop to step 2.

6. **Cap at 5 rounds** (or user-specified). Surface remaining findings.

### Synthesize

Skip if loop converged on Turn 1 (state file already holds full review).

Turn-N state files hold only that turn's delta. After multi-round convergence, produce a consolidated review:

```bash
bash .claude/skills/codex-plan-review/scripts/resume.sh \
    --prompt-file .claude/skills/codex-code-review/prompts/synthesize.tpl \
    <plan-path> "Today's date is YYYY-MM-DD"
```

Outputs `PROMOTION_READY` sentinel. `<x.y.z>` Version placeholder left unfilled (resolved during `TRIP-3-release`).

Edge cases:
- **Capped without APPROVED**: still synthesize; Codex notes open findings.
- **User skipped Codex**: no synthesis. The CR is written manually during `TRIP-3-release`: "Code review skipped — trivial change."

### Operating Notes

Surface reviews verbatim. Keep edits scoped. If Codex repeats a finding, re-read carefully — you likely addressed an adjacent concern. Reset thread only if context is confused. The testing gate (lint, typecheck, affected tests) must pass before APPROVED.

---

## Handoff to Release

After Codex converges (or is skipped):

- Cross the corresponding checkboxes in the plan todo list (if any)
- Then **use the `AskUserQuestion` tool** to ask:
  - **Question**: "Is the implementation complete?"
  - **Options**: "Yes, everything is complete" (proceed to release), "No, there are remaining items" (continue working)

**If "Yes"**: proceed directly into the release — read `.claude/skills/TRIP-3-release/SKILL.md` and follow it in this session, passing the same plan path (or feature label). The release skill owns everything from version bump to the fast-forward merge and push.

**If "No"**: continue working, then repeat the sequence: testing gate → Codex review → this question.
