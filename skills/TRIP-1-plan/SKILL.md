# Planning Mode

You are now in **planning mode** for **[PROJECT_NAME]**.

## Prerequisites - Read First

Before creating any plan, you MUST read ALL THE LINES of:

1. @docs/ARCHI.md - Understand current system architecture
2. @docs/charter.md - Stable intent: purpose, principles, scope, non-goals
3. `docs/adr/` - Skim titles and statuses; fully read every ADR touching the feature's area (guardrail ADRs especially)

## Your Task

Plan the following feature: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Step 1: Discovery & Clarification (Interactive)

**Do NOT start writing a plan immediately.** First, engage in a discovery conversation to fully understand the user's intent.

### 1.1 Initial Understanding

After reading the feature request, summarize your understanding in 2-3 sentences, then **use the `AskUserQuestion` tool** to present clarifying questions with structured options.

Frame questions around:

- **Scope**: What's included vs excluded?
- **Behavior**: How should it work from the user's perspective?
- **Constraints**: Any technical limitations, deadlines, or dependencies?
- **Priority**: What's most important if trade-offs are needed?

For each question, provide 2-4 concrete options based on your analysis of the codebase and the feature request. Always let the user provide custom input via the built-in "Other" option.

After the user answers, proceed **directly to writing the plan** (Step 2) — no approach-confirmation question. Ask a follow-up round with `AskUserQuestion` only if a blocking ambiguity remains (**maximum 3 rounds total**; if still unclear, summarize what you know and proceed with noted assumptions).

---

## Step 2: Plan Document Creation

Once understanding is confirmed, create the plan document.

### File Naming

Depending on the feature (major, minor, patch), propose a new version using SemVer (x.y.z) and create:
`docs/1-plans/F_[version]_[feature-name].plan.md`

### Required Sections

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

## Overview

[2-4 sentences describing the feature and its purpose]

## Problem Statement (if applicable)

[Current limitations/issues this feature addresses]

## Solution Architecture

[High-level design approach]

## Implementation Details

### 1. [Component/Module/File Name]

**File**: `path/to/file`

[Detailed description of changes needed]

**Current state** (if modifying existing):
[Describe what currently exists]

**Modifications**:

- Specific change 1 (around line X)
- Specific change 2 (around line Y)

### 2. [Next Component/Module/File]

[Continue with same pattern]

## Technical Considerations

- **Architecture Alignment**: How this plan conforms to the constraints in ARCHI.md (as-built) and reintroduces nothing the ADRs in `docs/adr/` have superseded or ruled out. Derive this from those documents at planning time — never from memory.
- **Doc Impact**: If this plan changes or supersedes anything the living docs state — everything in `docs/` outside the numbered per-release directories, plus CLAUDE.md and README.md — name the affected documents here. Enumerate that scope at planning time rather than working from a remembered list. `TRIP-3-release` consumes this list. An empty list is a claim ("this plan contradicts nothing documented"), not a default.
- **Process/Design Separation**: `.claude/skills/` files are never modified as part of a feature. If this plan appears to need a skill edit, that is a process change — propose it separately, commit it separately.
- **Layer Conventions**: For each layer/artifact type this plan adds to, state how the addition satisfies the conventions ARCHI.md documents for that layer (pulled at planning time).
- **Edge Cases**: [Relevant edge cases for this feature]

## Files to Modify/Create

[Comprehensive numbered list with purposes]

1. `path/to/file1` (modify) - Purpose description
2. `path/to/file2` (new) - Purpose description

## Type Definitions (if applicable)

[New types, interfaces, structs, or modifications to existing ones]

## Performance & Cost Impact (if applicable)

[Expected performance implications]

## Backward Compatibility (if applicable)

[Migration strategy if needed]

## Test Impact

[2-5 bullets: which existing tests the change affects, what new logic will need tests, whether an integration/E2E check applies. No test code — the TRIP-2 testing gate consumes this section.]

## To-dos

### Phase 1: [Phase Name] (if multiple phases are needed) or simply skip title if only one phase is needed

- [ ] Task description
- [ ] Another task

### Phase 2: [Phase Name] (if applicable)

- [ ] Task description
- [ ] Another task

**Note**: For simple plans, a single phase is sufficient. Split into multiple phases only for complex features requiring sequential implementation.

**Note**: Do NOT write test code during planning — the Test Impact section above only names what the TRIP-2 testing gate will run and author.
```

## ADR: When the Plan Changes Documented Intent

If the plan contradicts or supersedes anything ARCHI.md, charter.md, or a prior ADR states (i.e., the Doc Impact list names any of them), draft an ADR alongside the plan:

1. Copy `docs/adr/template.md` to `docs/adr/NNNN-<slug>.md` (next sequence number).
2. Status: `proposed`. Fill Relations (supersedes/amends) and the Plan-Release header with this plan's path (the release version is filled by `TRIP-3-release`).
3. **Adopting an existing `draft`** — if a design session already recorded this decision, do not write a second ADR. Validate the draft against the code, revise its body where planning proved it wrong (drafts are revisable; the no-retro-edit rule starts at `proposed`), discharge or restate anything in its `Gate`, fill in the Plan-Release header, and flip it to `proposed`. A draft in the plan's scope may be superseded with reasons but never silently ignored.
4. Guardrail decisions — things deliberately NOT built — are first-class ADRs; record them the same way.
5. Commit the ADR on the feature branch together with the plan. `TRIP-3-release` flips it to `accepted` when the release ships it.

If nothing documented changes, no ADR — do not create ceremony for conforming plans.

## Quality Standards

- **Zero Ambiguity**: Every step must be clear and actionable
- **File-Level Specificity**: List exact files and functions to modify
- **Risk Assessment**: Highlight potential failure points

---

## Step 3: Codex Second-Opinion Review

Before the user sees the plan, run the Codex plan review loop.

### Confirm

`AskUserQuestion`: "I'll run Codex as a second-opinion reviewer and iterate until clean. Proceed?"
Options: "Yes, run Codex review" (recommended) / "Skip Codex, go to user review" / "Cap iterations at N"

Skip for trivial plans (single-file, low-risk). Run for non-trivial (new module, schema/algorithm change).

### Loop

1. **Start**: `bash .claude/skills/codex-plan-review/scripts/start.sh --prompt-file .claude/skills/codex-plan-review/prompts/start.tpl <plan-path>`
2. **Parse trailing tag**: `APPROVED` -> Step 4. `NEEDS_REWORK` -> surface to user. `REQUEST_CHANGES` -> continue.
3. **Address findings critically** — quote each P1/P2, push back on incorrect ones, fix legitimate ones by editing the plan in place.
4. **Write implementer notes** (1-3 sentences): which findings you fixed, which you pushed back on and why, any user decisions that override existing docs or environment limitations that can't be resolved in the plan.
5. **Resume** with notes:
   ```bash
   bash .claude/skills/codex-plan-review/scripts/resume.sh \
       --prompt-file .claude/skills/codex-plan-review/prompts/resume.tpl \
       --notes "Fixed X. Pushed back on Y because Z. User decided W." \
       <plan-path>
   ```
   -> back to step 2.
6. **Cap at 5 rounds** (or user-specified). Surface remaining findings and let user decide.

Surface Codex reviews verbatim. Keep edits scoped to findings. Reset thread (`reset.sh <plan-path>`) only if context is genuinely confused.

---

## Step 4: User Review & Validation

After Codex review converges (or is skipped), present a summary to the user including:

- **Feature**: [name]
- **Approach**: [1-2 sentences]
- **Files affected**: [count] files ([list key ones])
- **Estimated complexity**: [simple/moderate/complex]
- **Codex status**: [APPROVED / skipped / capped at N rounds with open findings]

Then **use the `AskUserQuestion` tool** to collect feedback:

- **Question**: "Please review the plan at `docs/1-plans/F_x.y.z_feature-name.plan.md`. How would you like to proceed?"
- **Options**: "Approved" (ready for implementation), "Request changes" (I have modifications), "Needs rework" (significant issues to address)

Handle feedback:

- **If "Request changes"**: Update the plan and re-present. Run another Codex pass if changes are substantive.
- **If "Needs rework"**: Discuss issues, rework the plan, and re-present.
- **If "Other" (custom input)**: Handle accordingly.
- **If "Approved"**: **Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool** to ask:
  - **Question**: "Plan approved. Would you like to start implementation now?"
  - **Options**: "Yes, implement now" (proceed with `TRIP-2-implement` using this plan), "Not yet" (I'll implement later)

---

## IMPORTANT: No Code Implementation

**DO NOT write code snippets or implement anything during planning.**

This is a high-level planning phase only. Your plan should describe:

- WHAT needs to be done (features, changes, structures)
- WHERE changes will happen (files, modules, functions)
- WHY certain approaches are chosen (trade-offs, rationale)

But NOT:

- Actual code implementations
- Detailed algorithm code

Keep it architectural and descriptive. Code comes in the `TRIP-2-implement` phase.

## Layer Guidance

No per-layer design checklists live in this skill — they are caches that rot. When planning an addition to any layer, pull the conventions ARCHI.md documents for that layer at planning time and state in the plan how the addition satisfies them (see Technical Considerations → Layer Conventions).
